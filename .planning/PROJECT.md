# KKR Fan Website

## What This Is

A fan website dedicated to the Kolkata Knight Riders IPL team. It gives fans a polished, official-feeling destination to explore the full squad, dive into team stats across all IPL seasons, and browse action shot galleries of their favourite players.

## Core Value

Fans can discover everything about KKR — who's in the squad, how the team has performed across seasons, and experience the team through compelling player photography.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Player profiles with bio, IPL stats, photo, and jersey number
- [ ] Team stats covering historical seasons and the current season
- [ ] Action photo gallery with multiple shots per player
- [ ] KKR brand identity — purple/gold color scheme, official feel

### Out of Scope

- Live match scores/real-time updates — high complexity, API costs, not core to fan info site
- User accounts / community features — out of v1 scope
- Ticket purchasing — not a transactional site

## Context

- IPL team: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)
- Brand colors: purple and gold
- The site should feel polished and official, not amateur fan-made
- Content is relatively static (rosters, stats, gallery photos)

## Constraints

- **Content**: Data about players and historical stats will be sourced manually or from public IPL records
- **Media**: Player action photos will need to be curated/sourced

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Static fan site (no live data) | Avoids API costs and complexity for v1 | — Pending |
| KKR brand colors (purple/gold) | Official feel, matches team identity | — Pending |
