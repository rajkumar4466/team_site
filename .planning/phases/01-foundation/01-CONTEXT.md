# Phase 1: Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Build the branded site shell: KKR-themed homepage with a hero section, site-wide navigation to Players/Stats/Gallery, and a responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile. This is the structural foundation all later phases build on — no content, player data, or stats yet.

## Implementation Decisions

### Tech Stack
- Next.js (React) — framework
- Tailwind CSS — styling
- Vercel — deployment target

### Rendering Mode
- Claude's discretion (static export recommended — no server needed, fits a static fan site, deploys easily to Vercel)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact rendering strategy (static export vs SSR) — static export is the natural fit
- Component folder structure and naming conventions
- Font choices beyond the KKR purple/gold brand colors

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches for homepage layout, navigation, and responsive breakpoints.
