<objective>
Build the KKR player data layer and squad listing page.

Purpose: Establish the typed player data foundation and replace the /players placeholder with a real, browsable squad grid. This plan creates everything needed for the squad page; the profile pages follow in Plan 02.
Output: Player type definitions, static squad data (15+ KKR players), PlayerCard component, and a working /players grid page.

<interfaces>
<!-- Established patterns from Phase 1. Executor should follow these exactly. -->

From src/app/globals.css (@theme inline):
```css
--color-kkr-purple: #3A1078;
--color-kkr-purple-light: #5B2EA6;
--color-kkr-purple-dark: #260B52;
--color-kkr-gold: #FFD700;
/* Tailwind utilities: bg-kkr-purple, text-kkr-gold, bg-kkr-purple-dark, bg-kkr-purple-light, text-kkr-purple */
```

From src/app/players/page.tsx (current placeholder to REPLACE):
```tsx
export default function PlayersPage() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16 text-center">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-extrabold text-kkr-purple mb-4">KKR Squad</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg">Player profiles coming soon.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Layout pattern (from Phase 1 SUMMARY):
- All pages: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` for consistent layout
- Named exports for components: `export function ComponentName`
- `use client` directive only on components using React hooks
- next.config.ts has `images: { unoptimized: true }` — use `<img>` not `<Image>` from next/image
</interfaces>
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Define Player type and create static squad data</name>
  <files>src/types/player.ts, src/data/players.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `src/types/player.ts` with the Player interface:

```typescript
export interface Player {
  id: string;          // URL-safe slug, e.g. "shreyas-iyer"
  name: string;
  jerseyNumber: number;
  role: "Batsman" | "Bowler" | "All-rounder" | "Wicket-keeper";
  nationality: string; // e.g. "India", "Australia", "West Indies"
  age: number;         // age as of 2025 IPL season
  imageUrl: string;    // relative path e.g. "/images/players/shreyas-iyer.jpg" — files won't exist yet, that is fine
  bio: string;         // 1-2 sentence description
}
```

Create `src/data/players.ts` that imports the Player interface and exports:
1. `export const players: Player[]` — array of 16 KKR 2025 squad members. Use accurate real-world data for the IPL 2025 season. Include a mix of batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and at least one wicket-keeper. Representative players: Shreyas Iyer (captain, Batsman, India, jersey 41), Sunil Narine (All-rounder, West Indies, jersey 11), Andre Russell (All-rounder, West Indies, jersey 12), Varun Chakravarthy (Bowler, India), Rinku Singh (Batsman, India, jersey 12 — check for conflicts and adjust), Venkatesh Iyer (All-rounder, India), Phil Salt (Wicket-keeper, England), Harshit Rana (Bowler, India), Angkrish Raghuvanshi (Batsman, India), Moeen Ali (All-rounder, England), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (Wicket-keeper, Afghanistan), and fill to 16 with plausible KKR 2025 squad members. Use jersey numbers that match known assignments. Invent reasonable ages and short bios where exact data is unavailable — this is a static fan site.

2. `export function getPlayerBySlug(slug: string): Player | undefined` that returns `players.find(p => p.id === slug)`.

No default exports. Named exports only.

  <done>src/types/player.ts and src/data/players.ts exist with no TypeScript errors. players array has 16 entries. getPlayerBySlug exported.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: PlayerCard component and squad grid page</name>
  <files>src/components/PlayerCard.tsx, src/app/players/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/PlayerCard.tsx` — a server component (no hooks, no `use client`):

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';
import { Player } from '@/types/player';

export function PlayerCard({ player }: { player: Player }) {
  return (
    <Link href={`/players/${player.id}`} className="group block ...">
      {/* Jersey number badge top-right or top-left */}
      {/* Player image: <img src={player.imageUrl} alt={player.name} /> with fallback styling */}
      {/* Name, role, nationality */}
    </Link>
  );
}
```

Style the card using KKR brand colors:
- Card background: white with a kkr-purple top border (border-t-4 border-kkr-purple) and a subtle shadow
- Hover state: shadow-lg and a slight scale transform (group-hover:scale-105 transition-transform)
- Jersey number: displayed in a small kkr-gold badge (bg-kkr-gold text-kkr-purple-dark font-bold)
- Player name: text-kkr-purple font-bold text-lg
- Role + nationality: text-gray-500 text-sm
- Image area: bg-kkr-purple-light (placeholder color when image is missing) with aspect-square, rounded-t-lg, overflow-hidden. Use `<img>` tag (not next/image — images.unoptimized is set but img tag is simpler for static export with local paths). Add `onError` fallback via `onerror` attribute OR just use a div placeholder since images won't exist in this plan.
- Use a colored placeholder div (bg-kkr-purple-light h-40 w-full) instead of an img tag since player photos do not exist yet. Add a centered initials-style display.

Replace `src/app/players/page.tsx` entirely (it is currently a placeholder):
- Import `players` from `@/data/players`
- Import `PlayerCard` from `@/components/PlayerCard`
- Render a responsive grid: `grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6`
- Page header: "KKR Squad 2025" in text-kkr-purple font-extrabold text-4xl
- Subtitle: "IPL 2025 Season" in text-gray-500
- Map over `players` array rendering one `<PlayerCard>` per player, key={player.id}
- No `use client` directive — this is a pure server component (static data, no hooks)
  </action>

  <done>PlayerCard component exists with named export. /players page renders a 4-column grid of 16 player cards. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. out/players/index.html is generated.</done>

After both tasks complete:
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` exits 0 — no TypeScript errors
2. `npm run build` exits 0 — static export succeeds
3. `out/players/index.html` exists and contains player name text (grep for "Shreyas")
4. `src/types/player.ts` exports `Player` interface
5. `src/data/players.ts` exports `players` array (16 entries) and `getPlayerBySlug`
6. `src/components/PlayerCard.tsx` exports `PlayerCard` with named export
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User visits /players and sees a 4-column responsive grid (1-col mobile, 2-col sm, 3-col md, 4-col lg) of all 16 KKR squad members
- Each card shows: jersey number badge (kkr-gold), player initials placeholder, name (kkr-purple), role and nationality (gray)
- Cards are clickable links to /players/[slug] (destination built in Plan 02)
- Build compiles with zero errors
- All three requirements are partially addressed: PLAY-01 (squad grid done), PLAY-02 + PLAY-03 (data layer ready for Plan 02)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-players/02-01-SUMMARY.md`
