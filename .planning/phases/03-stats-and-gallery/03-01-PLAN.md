<objective>
Define TypeScript types and hardcode static data for KKR's season stats and gallery features.

Purpose: Establish the data contracts and populate all content that the stats and gallery pages will render. Static site — no APIs. All data lives in these files.
Output: Four new files — two type definition files, two data files — that Plans 03-02 and 03-03 consume directly.

<!-- Existing types the executor should be aware of (do NOT modify). -->

From src/types/player.ts:
```typescript
export interface Player {
  id: string;          // URL-safe slug, e.g. "shreyas-iyer"
  name: string;
  jerseyNumber: number;
  role: "Batsman" | "Bowler" | "All-rounder" | "Wicket-keeper";
  nationality: string;
  age: number;
  imageUrl: string;    // relative path e.g. "/images/players/shreyas-iyer.jpg"
  bio: string;

From src/data/players.ts (key players for gallery data):
```typescript
// Player IDs in the squad: shreyas-iyer, sunil-narine, andre-russell,

**File 1: src/data/stats.ts**

Import SeasonRecord and TopPerformer from "../types/stats".

Export `seasonRecords: SeasonRecord[]` — KKR's complete IPL history (2008-2024). Use accurate historical data:
- 2008: KKR finished 8th (wins: 6, losses: 8, noResult: 0, position: 8, title: false)
- 2009: position 7 (wins: 5, losses: 8, noResult: 1, title: false)
- 2010: position 6 (wins: 7, losses: 7, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2011: position 5 (wins: 8, losses: 6, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2012: position 1, title: true (wins: 12, losses: 4, noResult: 0)
- 2013: position 2 (wins: 11, losses: 5, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2014: position 1, title: true (wins: 11, losses: 3, noResult: 0)
- 2015: position 5 (wins: 8, losses: 6, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2016: position 7 (wins: 7, losses: 7, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2017: position 8 (wins: 5, losses: 9, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2018: position 7 (wins: 6, losses: 8, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2019: position 5 (wins: 6, losses: 8, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2020: position 7 (wins: 7, losses: 7, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2021: position 6 (wins: 7, losses: 7, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2022: position 7 (wins: 6, losses: 8, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2023: position 5 (wins: 7, losses: 7, noResult: 0, title: false)
- 2024: position 1, title: true (wins: 11, losses: 3, noResult: 0)

Export `topPerformers: TopPerformer[]` with KKR all-time leaders. List top 5 run-scorers first, then top 5 wicket-takers:

Run-scorers (category: "runs"):
- Sunil Narine — total: 3500, seasons: 13
- Robin Uthappa — total: 3145, seasons: 8
- Gautam Gambhir — total: 2982, seasons: 7
- Rinku Singh — total: 1280, seasons: 5
- Brendon McCullum — total: 1217, seasons: 3

Wicket-takers (category: "wickets"):
- Sunil Narine — total: 178, seasons: 13
- Umesh Yadav — total: 82, seasons: 5
- Andre Russell — total: 80, seasons: 11
- Kuldeep Yadav — total: 67, seasons: 4
- Varun Chakravarthy — total: 58, seasons: 4

**File 2: src/data/gallery.ts**

Import GalleryEntry from "../types/gallery".

Export `galleryEntries: GalleryEntry[]` — hardcoded photo entries for 6 key KKR players. Since actual images do not exist on disk, use placeholder paths following the pattern `/images/gallery/{player-id}-{n}.jpg` (n = 1, 2, 3). Write descriptive alt text and captions that describe action moments.

Include entries for these 6 players with 3 photos each:
1. shreyas-iyer / Shreyas Iyer
2. sunil-narine / Sunil Narine
3. andre-russell / Andre Russell
4. rinku-singh / Rinku Singh
5. varun-chakravarthy / Varun Chakravarthy
6. mitchell-starc / Mitchell Starc

Example entry structure:
```typescript
{
  playerId: "shreyas-iyer",
  playerName: "Shreyas Iyer",
  photos: [
    {
      url: "/images/gallery/shreyas-iyer-1.jpg",
      alt: "Shreyas Iyer plays a cover drive at Eden Gardens",
      caption: "Elegant cover drive, IPL 2024",
    },
    {
      url: "/images/gallery/shreyas-iyer-2.jpg",
      alt: "Shreyas Iyer raises his bat after reaching fifty",
      caption: "Fifty celebration, IPL 2024 Final",
    },
    {
      url: "/images/gallery/shreyas-iyer-3.jpg",
      alt: "Shreyas Iyer lifts the IPL trophy",
      caption: "Champion captain, IPL 2024",
    },
  ],
},
```

Write similarly vivid, realistic captions for the other 5 players describing cricket action moments specific to each player's known role/style (Narine spinning, Russell hitting sixes, Rinku finishing, Chakravarthy bowling, Starc swinging).
  </action>
  <verify>npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20</verify>
  <done>
- src/data/stats.ts exports seasonRecords (17 entries, 2008-2024) and topPerformers (10 entries)
- src/data/gallery.ts exports galleryEntries (6 player entries, 3 photos each)
- npx tsc --noEmit reports zero TypeScript errors
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

Run after all tasks complete:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Expected: zero errors. All four files exist:
- src/types/stats.ts (SeasonRecord, TopPerformer interfaces)
- src/types/gallery.ts (GalleryPhoto, GalleryEntry interfaces)
- src/data/stats.ts (seasonRecords 17 entries, topPerformers 10 entries)
- src/data/gallery.ts (galleryEntries 6 players x 3 photos)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All four files exist at specified paths
- TypeScript compilation passes with zero errors
- seasonRecords array has exactly 17 entries spanning 2008-2024
- topPerformers array has 10 entries (5 runs, 5 wickets)
- galleryEntries array has 6 entries with 3 photos each
- title: true set for 2012, 2014, 2024
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-stats-and-gallery/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
