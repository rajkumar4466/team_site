must_haves:
  truths:
    - "User can browse a gallery of action shots at /gallery organized by player"
    - "Each player section shows 3 photo cards with captions describing the action moment"
    - "Photo cards render a purple placeholder where actual images would load"
    - "Gallery page uses KKR purple/gold branding consistent with Phase 1 and 2 visual language"
    - "Gallery page is a pure server component — no use client, no runtime data fetching"
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/app/gallery/page.tsx"
      provides: "Gallery page with player photo grids"
      exports: [default GalleryPage]

    - from: "src/app/gallery/page.tsx"

<objective>
Build the Gallery page — replacing the placeholder stub at /gallery with a full player photo grid implementation.

Purpose: Satisfy GALL-01 (multi-photo player gallery) for the KKR fan site. Pure server component importing static data from Plan 03-01's data files.
Output: src/app/gallery/page.tsx fully implemented with 6 player sections and 3 photo cards each.

<!-- Types and data contracts created by Plan 03-01. Executor must import these exactly as shown — no codebase exploration needed. -->

From src/types/gallery.ts:
```typescript
export interface GalleryPhoto {
  url: string;           // relative path e.g. "/images/gallery/shreyas-iyer-1.jpg"
  alt: string;           // descriptive alt text for accessibility
  caption: string;       // short caption shown below photo in UI
}

export interface GalleryEntry {
  playerId: string;      // matches Player.id slug, e.g. "shreyas-iyer"
  playerName: string;    // display name, e.g. "Shreyas Iyer"
  photos: GalleryPhoto[]; // 3+ photos per player
}
```

From src/data/gallery.ts:
```typescript
import { GalleryEntry } from "../types/gallery";
export const galleryEntries: GalleryEntry[];  // 6 players x 3 photos each
// Players: shreyas-iyer, sunil-narine, andre-russell, rinku-singh, varun-chakravarthy, mitchell-starc
```

Brand tokens (Tailwind v4, defined via @theme in globals.css — use as utility classes):
- text-kkr-purple, bg-kkr-purple, border-kkr-purple
- text-kkr-gold, bg-kkr-gold
- bg-kkr-purple-light, bg-kkr-purple-dark, text-kkr-purple-dark

Established patterns from Phase 2:
- Pure server component — NO "use client" directive
- Pages use `export default function` (not named exports)
- Use `<img>` tag (not next/image) — static export convention established in Phase 1
- Consistent heading: text-4xl font-extrabold text-kkr-purple mb-4
- Page wrapper: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16
- Use @/ path alias for imports (e.g. "@/data/gallery", "@/types/gallery")

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Gallery page with player photo grids</name>
  <files>src/app/gallery/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the placeholder stub at src/app/gallery/page.tsx with a full implementation.

**Page structure:**

```
Page wrapper: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16

H1: "KKR Gallery" — text-4xl font-extrabold text-kkr-purple mb-2
Subtitle: "Action shots from our favourite KKR moments" — text-gray-500 text-lg mb-12

For each GalleryEntry in galleryEntries (map over the array):

  Player section:
    H2: entry.playerName — text-2xl font-bold text-kkr-purple mb-4 border-l-4 border-kkr-gold pl-3
    Photo grid: grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mb-12

    For each photo in entry.photos (map):
      Photo card: bg-gray-100 rounded-xl overflow-hidden shadow-sm

        Image:
          <img> tag with src={photo.url} alt={photo.alt}
          Classes: w-full h-48 object-cover bg-kkr-purple-light
          Since images are placeholders (don't exist on disk), the bg-kkr-purple-light background
          color shows instead — this is intentional and correct behavior

        Caption:
          <p> with photo.caption — text-sm text-gray-600 px-3 py-2
```

Use the entry's playerId as the key on the outer map (key={entry.playerId}). Use the photo's url as the key on the inner map (key={photo.url}).

Pure server component — NO "use client". Import galleryEntries from "@/data/gallery". Import GalleryEntry and GalleryPhoto from "@/types/gallery" if needed for inline type annotations.

Use `<img>` tag (NOT next/image) — consistent with static export convention from Phase 1 and 2.

  <done>
- src/app/gallery/page.tsx is a server component importing from @/data/gallery
- Page renders 6 player sections (shreyas-iyer through mitchell-starc)
- Each player section has 3 photo cards with captions
- Photo areas render with bg-kkr-purple-light since actual images are not on disk
- npm run build succeeds with zero errors
  </done>
</task>

After task completion:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

Expected:
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Static build succeeds
- out/gallery/index.html exists in build output
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- src/app/gallery/page.tsx renders 6 player sections each with 3 photo cards
- Photo cards show bg-kkr-purple-light placeholder where actual images would load
- npm run build passes cleanly (static export)
- Page matches KKR brand (purple/gold) consistent with Phases 1 and 2
- Page does not use "use client"
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-stats-and-gallery/03-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
