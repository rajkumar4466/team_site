  <name>Verify Stats and Gallery pages in browser</name>
  <what-built>
Stats page (src/app/stats/page.tsx):
- Season-by-season record table for all 17 KKR IPL seasons (2008-2024)
- IPL Champion gold badge on 2012, 2014, and 2024 rows
- Top performers section: two cards — KKR's top 5 run-scorers and top 5 wicket-takers
- KKR purple/gold styling consistent with the rest of the site

Gallery page (src/app/gallery/page.tsx):
- 6 player sections (Shreyas Iyer, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Varun Chakravarthy, Mitchell Starc)
- 3 photo cards per player with captions describing action moments
- Photo areas render as bg-kkr-purple-light (placeholder) since actual images are not on disk
- Player names as section headings with gold left border accent
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`

2. Open http://localhost:3000/stats
   - Confirm the page heading reads "KKR Season Stats"
   - Confirm the season records table has rows for every year from 2008 through 2024 (17 rows)
   - Confirm the 2012, 2014, and 2024 rows show a gold "IPL Champion" badge
   - Confirm all other rows show a position number (e.g. "#8", "#5")
   - Confirm the "All-Time Top Performers" section has two cards side by side (stacked on mobile)
   - Confirm each card lists 5 players with names, totals, and units (runs / wkts)

3. Open http://localhost:3000/gallery
   - Confirm the page heading reads "KKR Gallery"
   - Confirm 6 player sections are visible: Shreyas Iyer, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Varun Chakravarthy, Mitchell Starc
   - Confirm each player section has 3 photo cards arranged in a grid
   - Confirm each photo card shows a caption below the image area
   - Confirm photo placeholders render as a purple block (images are not on disk — this is correct)

4. From the stats page, click the Navbar "Players" link — confirm it navigates to /players
5. From the gallery page, click the Navbar "Stats" link — confirm it navigates back to /stats

6. Optional — run static build check:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   Confirm: zero errors, out/stats/index.html and out/gallery/index.html exist
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if everything looks correct, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>
